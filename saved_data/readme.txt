contains saved binary data to run on the transformer.

some misleading naming, should change them later

dataset_d_15k.pkl-> contains 18k trainig data
dataset_e_15k.pkl-> contains 2k testing data

so these will be changed here to dataset_d_18k.pkl and dataset_e_2k.pkl
but still as it was run while the names still contained 15k the logs of the transformer contains 15k in the txt file
but we can see there are sample_size = 18000

---------------

noast_e_20k512.pkl contains 2k data, should be renamed as noast_e_2k512.pkl
